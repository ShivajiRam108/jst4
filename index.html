<!-- 4. Scenario: Vehicle Management
You are managing a fleet of vehicles. Each vehicle has a model, license plate, and mileage. You need to track the mileage whenever the vehicle is driven.
•             Question:
 How would you define a Vehicle class with properties model, licensePlate, and mileage?
–            What methods would you include to:
•             Simulate driving the vehicle (e.g., drive(miles) method, which increases the mileage)?
•             Get the current mileage of the vehicle (e.g., getMileage() method)? -->
